The project is about understanding what good yelp reviews look like (Here the "good" reviews mean the reviews with higher review votes).
For solving the problems, I used text analysis techniques such as count vectorizer and tfidf vectorizer and also classification model techniques including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes.

The project consists of four parts:
- Data Wrangling: See details in "Python Script.ipynb"
- Data Exploratory Analysis: See details in "Python Script.ipynb"
- In-depth Analysis & Modeling: See details in "Python Script.ipynb"
- Insight Presentation: See details in the presentation folder

The documentation for the project has been included within the script and presentation slide.
