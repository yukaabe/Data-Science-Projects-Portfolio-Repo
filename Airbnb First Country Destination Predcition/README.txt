Airbnb First Country Destination:
The project is about making prediction on the destination country where users will make their first booking by leveraging users' profile
and their web activities. 

To solve the problem, I have leveraged feature enginnering and classfication model algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XG Boost.
