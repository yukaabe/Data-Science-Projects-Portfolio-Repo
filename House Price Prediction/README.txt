The project is about making prediction on the house sale price based on 79 attributes of properties in Ames, Iowa.
For solving the problem, I used some advanced regression model techniques including:
- Feature selection & feature engineering
- Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)
- Boosting algorithms (Grandient Boosting, Light GBM and XG boost regressors)
- Model ensembling (stacking base estimators)

The whole data science project consists of three steps:

- Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis: See details in the "Python Script - Data Cleaning & EDA.ipynb" within the "Python Script" folder
- In-depth analysis and modeling: See details in "Python Script Modeling Part.ipynb" within the "Python Script" folder
- Insight/Solution Presentation: See details in the "Presentation" folder

For Documentation, see details in the "Documentation" folder:
- Read "Data_MetaData_Documentation.xlsx" to check: 
    metadata, signicance (p value and F value), relevance (R Squared) and outlier & missing data detection details for each of the fields in the dataset
- Read "Capstone project 2 House Price Prediction milestone report.pdf" to understand the details of each step of the whole project
